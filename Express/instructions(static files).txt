setup static files
1) Create a folder called public
2) Create three folders inside inside
   -image
   -styles
   -javascript
   (can be named anything but these are industry standards)
3) Configure the express static
   app.use(express.static("./public"));
4) understand the path (don't include public name while including stylesheet in ejs file also same for javascript file)
